                    Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, 
                    but he stops to sniff something every few steps. Hes pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell. 
                </p>
                <p class = "grid-item">
                    Whenever it's movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will 
                    play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.
                </p>

                    Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it laying around the house in his various favorite spots. Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks, 
                    but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off. He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.

                <p class = "grid-item">
                    He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too.
                    Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy

                    Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy. Oftentimes, destroying anything
                    in her path she will take and hide all your socks, shoes, and clothes for her to chew 
                    on. She loves playing catch at the park, it always gives her the zoomies.

                <p class = "grid-item">
                    Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog. She really embraces her inner 
                    chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or noise at night. She makes the perfect 
                    guard dog. But she is not at all aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!

                <p class = "grid-item">
                    Nickels was adopted from Ohio in 2010. He turned 13 years old in June 2023, which he celebrated 
                    with a Taylor Swift themed birthday party. Nickels often travels with his family; he has been to 
                    over ten states. He has lived in Illinois and California. Nickels is a very unique dog- he is 
                    allergic to meat. His favorite word is “present.” His one true joy is receiving and opening gifts 
                    with his family. 
                </p>
                <p class = "grid-item">
                    In 2020, Nickels’ brought home a new dog: Socks. Socks is potentially the villain in Nickels’ life. 
                    He destroys Nickels’ favorite toys and is highly allergic to peanut butter, which means Nickels now 
                    rarely gets his favorite treat! However, when you find them sharing a dog bed, you wonder if the 
                    sibling rivalry is all a facade.

                <p class = "grid-item">
                    Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks 
                    and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find 
                    him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or 
                    cooling off in the garage.

                <p class = "grid-item">
                    He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky 
                    gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high 
                    when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle 
                    just as much as he likes to play
